          <p>I have always been fascinated by things I don’t understand or find difficult. This probably stems from me being very dyslexic at a young age. Having difficulty to read and write or even remember things has forced me over the years to find creative ways to understand and overcome obstacles. Nonetheless, I have learned to appreciate this and see it as a blessing in many ways as I don’t think it’s always good to look at things in a black and white or from A to B. Struggling to understand things makes me more curious and has me delve deeper.         For example, I was motivated to learn how to speak Spanish as I also had to learn about the country, culture, history and people to really understand it and use it.

          This passion inspired me to discover more languages out there. Although, my motivation led me to learn more technical languages in the world of coding. I didn't understand much about code before but I now really love it, as it encourages you to think about solving problems in an unconventional and creative way. The course at GA has given me a deeper appreciation for software development and how it has a prominent influence in the world we live in today. Also, it has inspired me to become ingrained in this world to create products that will positively influence people by its functionality as well as creativity.
